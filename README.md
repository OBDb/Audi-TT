This repository contains signal set configurations for the Audi TT, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Audi TT.

## Generations

The Audi TT has gone through three main generations since its introduction in 1998:

- **Mk1/8N (1998-2006)**: The first generation TT was based on the Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform and featured a distinctive rounded design that closely resembled the original 1995 concept car. Available in both coupe and roadster body styles, it was initially offered with a 1.8L turbocharged four-cylinder engine in various power outputs, later adding a 3.2L VR6 engine option. The Mk1 TT became iconic for its Bauhaus-inspired design with a minimal, architectural interior featuring aluminum accents. After early high-speed stability issues, Audi added a rear spoiler and ESP to improve handling characteristics.

- **Mk2/8J (2006-2014)**: The second generation TT was built on the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform, featuring a more angular design while maintaining the distinctive silhouette of the original. It utilized more aluminum in its construction, making it lighter and more agile than its predecessor. Engine options expanded to include 2.0L TFSI and 2.5L inline-five cylinders in the high-performance TT RS model, which produced up to 360 hp. The Mk2 also introduced Audi's magnetic ride adaptive damping system and a more driver-focused interior with the availability of the Audi Virtual Cockpit in later models.

- **Mk3/8S (2014-present)**: The current third generation TT is based on the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, further refining the model's design language while significantly advancing its technology. It features a fully digital instrument cluster (Audi Virtual Cockpit) which replaced the traditional center console screen. Weight was further reduced through the use of advanced materials, improving both performance and efficiency. Engine options include various 2.0L TFSI four-cylinder units, with the TT RS offering a potent 2.5L five-cylinder producing up to 400 hp. The third generation emphasizes digital integration and driver-centric technology while maintaining the TT's reputation for combining style with performance.
